> We are Javier and Paula, passioned for agriculture, plant physiology, and crop production specifically Corn and Sorghum. We opened this space to share our research, bring information to everyone interested in agriculture, and connect with the community.

We are both from Argentina, where we met back in 2013 during the bachelor’s degree at the Universidad Nacional del Nordeste (UNNE). We graduated from the same university as agronomist engineers, and we decided to continue our education in the US. So, we jumped in a plane and here we are in Manhattan, KS working at Kansas State University since 2017.

Javier after finishing his BS in Argentina, got a Fulbright scholarship to continue his education in the United States. He decided to start his Ph.D. in agronomy at K-State under Dr. Ignacio Ciampitti’s direction during fall 2017. His research focused on fertilization responses on yields, nitrogen (N) uptake, grain quality, and N use efficiency across contrasting hybrids.

Paula started working at K-State in Ciampitti Lab in April 2018 as a research scholar, performing lab analysis and field activities. She started her master’s degree in agronomy in January 2020 and her research focuses on yield gain and related traits in US Sorghum hybrids.

We will be graduating in December 2021, and we are looking forward to new adventures and challenges to come. We would love for you to stick around and share with us this space to talk about science, research, and much more related to agriculture.
